# Smart CO2 Monitoring System

## Project Overview

This project is an intelligent system for measuring and controlling CO2 levels in indoor environments. It aims to monitor air quality, ensuring safe and comfortable conditions for living or working spaces.

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Software Development:** Implementation of C++ code to manage the sensor, collect data, process it, and visualize results. The program ensures precise CO2 level measurement and can be adapted to work with various sensors and external interfaces.
2. **Sensor Case Design:** Creation of a 3D model for the sensor casing using OpenSCAD. The casing is designed with a focus on ergonomics, ease of assembly, and protection of electronic components.
